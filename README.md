Caesar Cipher Tool
A simple Python program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. This command-line tool allows users to enter a message and a shift value to perform secure, basic text transformations.

📌 Features
Encrypt any alphabetic message with a custom shift.

Decrypt messages using the same shift used for encryption.

Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Ignores and preserves non-alphabetic characters like spaces, punctuation, and numbers.

Easy-to-use menu-driven interface.

🚀 Getting Started
🔧 Requirements
Python 3.x installed

No external libraries are required.

🖥️ How to Use
Clone or download this repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Run the program:
python caesar_cipher.py
Choose from the menu:

Enter 1 to Encrypt a message.

Enter 2 to Decrypt a message.

Enter 3 to Exit the program.

💡 Example
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
Enter the message to encrypt: Hello World
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted Message: Khoor Zruog
🧠 How Caesar Cipher Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter by a number of positions in the alphabet.

Example: A with shift 3 becomes D

Wrapping is handled: Z with shift 1 becomes A
